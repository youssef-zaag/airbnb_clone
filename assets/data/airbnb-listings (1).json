I have worked as interpreter and translator, conferences organizer, personal assistant to Managing Directors and my last job was as chief editor in Economist Intelligent Life magazine for Greece.

I only visited a few europen countries and the USA, so I still I have lot to see and visit! I'd love to go in India and Sri Lanka, maybe taking a bigger tour and passing from Pakistan as well. But I'd also like to go to Marokko or Tunisia... let's say I'd like to go everywhere around the world! I still do not have a plan but it's on my list :)\r\nI'm a traveller, but not a turist, I like to meet the local people, talk to them and try to do a full immersion in the new culture. I do not travel just for seeing new places, I like to travel to experience a new way of living and thinking. That's why I think that airbnb is perfect for my purpose :) My place is not a elengant hotel, it's a cozy 2room apartment and you will feel like at home. So if you are looking for a super new cool apartment, that's not the right place. But if you are looking for clean and cozy place and a friendly italian host, here I am! :)",

I never stop exploring, discovering and evolving.\r\nI love the Arts and creative people! Life to me is a storybook full of fascinating tales. I amass information 'on the hoof' and very little passes me by. Understanding what makes others tick is meat and drink to me and proves to be a source of endless joy.\r\nI always keep my mind active. I love beauty in all forms, I am well educated and I like to remain totally classless. This makes it easy for me to get on with just about any sort of person. I am thought-provoking and even quite deep on occasions.\r\nI organise luxury tours in Italy for small parties and occasionally I escort them, as I am a professional tour guide too. I get involved in other exciting things which keep me busy too, such as painting, reading books, newspaper and cultural magazines, photography, video editing, cycling, theatre, music, fitness and movies.\r\nI strongly believe a very clean, secure, welcoming feel, and comfortable house is of paramount importance for travellers who don't want to break their bank account! \r\nI have been travelling on my own since the age of 14! I have been an exchange student in Baltimore for a year at the age of 18  and then at 20 I visited 36 States in the U.S. on a three cross Country tour. Been in Hawaii, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia, Maldives, Brazil,  Mexico, Costa Rica, Morocco, Tunisia, Cape Verde, Turkey and all Western European Countries.\r\nWhen you stay at my place I will make you feel a member of my family as my life's golden rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated! \r\nI am always on an adventure. Enjoy hearing about people's travels and life styles. It stands to good reason why you would enjoy staying in my home: it is a warm and caring place. \r\nI look forward to meeting you and show the true Mediterranean hospitality with an English twist!\r\nSincerely,\r\nAdriano :-)\r\n\r\nSocializzo con facilit\u00e0, rido di gusto, mi intrigano i cervelli acuti e mi innervosicono gli arroganti prepotenti; mi annoiano i \"lagnosi\" fine a se stessi ma ascolto volentieri chi ha bisogno di un consiglio o di un sostegno per trovare una soluzione. Non sopporto le ingiustizie, la superficialit\u00e0 e mi innamoro di chi \u00e8 capace di godere delle piccole cose e di chi, come dice Aristotele, \"prova un senso di dubbio e di meraviglia, riconosce di non sapere e per liberarsi dall'ignoranza ricerca il conoscere...\"",

Indeed, so famous is the film Notting Hill that I find scarcely a week goes by without someone or other asking me about the various set locations: the blue door, the travel bookshop, the garden fence and so on. Portobello Market takes up most of what is actually more properly called Portobello Road, it stretches for around two miles, although on a crowded saturday afternoon it takes quite a while to walk from end to end.",

Askew Road is two minute's walk away and offers fabulous bakeries and cake shops, an excellent butcher, two supermarkets, a library and a great pub. You also have the option of dining out at Tunisian, Persian, Japanese, Thai, Nepalese and good old fish and chips. All on the Askew Road!  No need to get on a bus or tube if you want evening entertainment. Apart from pubs and restaurants, we are less than a mile from the newly-refurbished Bush Theatre, Bush Hall (boasting a famous history of now legendary acts), as well as the Shepherds Bush Empire for more music events.  We are also less than a mile from Westfield Shopping Centre; countless shops and a multiplex cinema at your disposal. For the more outdoorsy, it's a 20 min walk to the river through Ravenscourt Park (three playgrounds, basketball courts, football and tennis, cafe and paddling pool), and once on the river you can walk, bike or jog for miles in either direction.",

At the ferry terminal in Staten Island you catch the subway and get off at the 3rd stop (Clifton) and we are just a block away from the subway station. So 30 minutes for the ferry ride and another 15 minutes for the Staten Island metro, in 45 minutes you are in lower Manhattan. And that is just the cost of pubic transportation, 2.75 (or less with a weekly unlimited card). There are also express buses running from various points of Manhattan to Staten Island. With these express buses you can travel to/from Manhattan in 20-30 minutes. The cost of these is 6.

minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace

It is very pleasant in the day and you can just walk around the narrow cobbled streets and discover the history of the city, from ancient Arab times to the so-called \u201cMadrid de los Austrias\u201d, Madrid's Mediaeval quarter. It is also the place to go for tapas, especially on Sunday afternoon but the place is also bustling on Friday and Saturday night, when young Spaniards and foreigners alike fill the many pubs, restaurants and tapas bars.",

I love my job as it gives me the opportunity to do some of the things I like most: talking and communicating, meeting people and travelling around the world. \r\n\r\nI love languages: I am bilingual in Spanish and English and I can also speak French and Arabic. I am particularly interested in Arabic language and culture. I have been studying Arabic since 2007, mainly in Spain but also in Arab countries like Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. I have also been to other countries in North Africa, the Middle East and the Gulf (Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar). \r\n\r\nFinally, I am educated, mature, approachable, respectful and easygoing, and I enjoy a good conversation over a coffee or a dinner party at home as much as going out and clubbing.",

        "host_about": "My name is Alfredo, I was born in Rome and I always lived here. \r\nI'm a normal guy that doesn't accept to be normal, so very soon I make a mess in my life. \r\nI am open minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

I adore enjoying the relaxed atmosphere of local cafes and pubs of my neighbourhoods, its international life and its traditional architecture. I am from the south of Italy, no doubts I love good food and wine. Though I love cooking, I adore the incredible selection of restaurants and street food London offers.\r\nI can\u2019t live without my music (jazz, soul, bossanova and opera) and time to time I treat myself with a concert or gig - London is offers the best choice of music, theatre and arts!\r\nI love sports and I am closed to some of the most beautiful London\u2019s parks and the Thames bank where I can enjoy a relaxing stroll as well as a good run. Travelling is my greatest passion. I have lived in the north and the south of Italy, in Belgium and Tunisia and I brought with me bits of them. I have been travelling in America, Africa and Asia and it is time to make the most of living in such a beautiful part of the world: Europe!",

My cats Tabitha and Gigia are pretty calm, but they're used to jump on the table and to drink from the sink. Lot of fur around :-) but I try to clean as much as possibile. So come only if you love animals and if you are used to them, or you will be unconfortable, and the animals and me too.  I don't accept children: read before why.",

For 5 euros extra you will be able to wash your clothes with a biodegrable soap ;-)  You could leave small stuff in the fridge but please only things that have a vegetable origin, my fridge is vegan! :-)  You cannot use the kitchen for cooking for insurance reason.  Breakfast is not included.  There is unlimited wi-fi access to the internet in the house!  There is a TV but it's only to watch DVD, I don't like on-air tv!

I will be happy to hear your stories, to give you turistic suggestions, to do something togheter if you'll like, to share a bit of live ;-) I am very open minded and I always lived in Rome so I'm quite experienced! I am a warm and nice guy. But sometimes I can be busy so don't get offended if happens that I could not interact a lot with you.",

minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

Apart from Toronto, I have lived in London, with extended stays in New York and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nI am an avid theatergoer and love to travel. I have traveled throughout Europe and the US, and have also visited Tunisia and Mexico. Brazil and Argentina are the next destinations on my list. Apart from English, I can attempt French and, if you\u2019re patient, Spanish. Definitely not fluent, but almost enough to get by!\r\n\r\nHaving travelled a lot myself, I know how nice it can be to have a place that you can call your own while you are away from home. Welcome to my place, and I hope you have a wonderful time visiting Toronto. I will do my best to make your experience both comfortable and enjoyable. - Paul",

There is a supermarket 150m from the building and a bakery on the same side of the street to get croissants. On the neighboring Canal de l\u2019Ourcq two movie theaters draw a crowd, and so do restaurants and cafes by the water. It\u2019s ideal to dine outside or go for a brunch on the weekend. The Canal de l\u2019Ourcq then becomes the Canal Saint Martin, a favorite picnic place for Parisians. Picturesque park Buttes Chaumont is only 10 minute away. It has lawns, hills, a lake, and games for the children. It is perfect for an afternoon of fresh air. The nearest tourist attraction is Cit\u00e9 de la Villette. It hosts a Science and Industry Museum, with interactive exhibitions that children love, and a 360\u00b0 IMAX movie theater. It is located in the Park de la Villette, a nic",

To reach St. Peter's Basilica it is a 10 minute walk; simply walk along the Vatican Walls and you are there! To reach the Spanish Steps you can take the Metro A (red line) for 4 stops from Cipro, getting off at Piazza di Spagna station. Alternatively, the bus 49 passing on Viale Vaticano, therefore near the easier entrance of the flat, takes you in 10 minutes to Piazza Cavour; from there you can reach the Historical Center of Rome in 5 minutes walk, crossing Ponte Cavour (Via Tomacelli, Via del Corso, Via Condotti and Piazza di Spagna).

I am from the south of Italy, no doubts I love good food and wine. Though I love cooking, I adore the incredible selection of restaurants and street food London offers.\r\nI can\u2019t live without my music (jazz, soul, bossanova and opera) and time to time I treat myself with a concert or gig - London is offers the best choice of music, theatre and arts!\r\nI love sports and I am closed to some of the most beautiful London\u2019s parks and the Thames bank where I can enjoy a relaxing stroll as well as a good run. Travelling is my greatest passion. I have lived in the north and the south of Italy, in Belgium and Tunisia and I brought with me bits of them.

Let me show you around.\r\nI live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. \r\n I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.\r\nAs a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.\r\nIn addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (URL HIDDEN) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.\r\nWelcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!",

It is also possible to drive, although you would need to take the ferry at the Tronchetto terminal in Venice. There is a network of bus, bringing people to the  secluded Murazzi beaches and to Pallestrina along the coast. It is also easy to rent bikes (including tandem) to explore this golden island.",

When in Venice, it is my pleasure trying to pass them as much cultural and practical knowledge  of the city as I can.",

        "host_about": "My name is Alfredo, I was born in Rome and I always lived here. \r\nI'm a normal guy that doesn't accept to be normal, so very soon I make a mess in my life. \r\nI am open minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

However if you would like to visit the Train market in Embajadores you may need to catch transport not to get lost. The metro is close by 5 mins walking and there are 3 different lines you can catch La Latina, Sol (metro & cercanias, which is the fast train) and Opera, they are the 3 closest metros to the apartment. Atocha train station is only a short walk 10-15mins and there is an Airport transfer bus that stops in all terminals and is fairly direct.",

Maria has a PhD in Enviromental Microbiology and is a professor, and I (Caterina) am a Cardiologist in Hospital Universitari Son Espases.  We are really hardworking, but we like enjoying little pleasures that life offers, such as travelling, tasting different culture gastronomy, doing sport (mainly road cycling, that is one of the most touristic attraction of Mallorca), reading (that is a thing that my sister loves), etc. Nevertheless,  one of our most pleasures is the fact that we have the opportunity to live in an island like Mallorca, which has a huge diversity of landscapes and a big quantity of different activities to do!\r\n\r\nHe have been travelling a lot (Berlin, Stuttgart, Prague, Paris, Rome, London, Edinburgh, Tunisia, Mexico, Vietnam, etc.) and we have experimented many situations (good ones and not so good ones) that helped us to know what is important for a traveller. It is for that reason that if you are thinking about being our guest, we will try to help you in whatever you need and try you to have an enjoying stay in Ca Na Servera. \r\n\r\nAn essential thing for a traveller is to find a place where he/she could rest and feel like home after spending a long day visiting different places. That is what we would like for us and, hence, what we would try to achive for you.\r\n\r\nAnd more or less, this is our \u201ctravel philosophy\u201d!!\r\n\r\nDEUTSCH\r\nHallo !!\r\n\r\nWir sind Maria und Caterina Mas, direkten Besitzer von Ca Na Servera.\r\n\r\nWir sind zwei Schwestern, die auf Mallorca leben und arbeiten. Mary ist PhD in Umweltmikrobiologie und arbeitet als Lehrer, w\u00e4hrend ich (Caterina) bin Kardiologe in Mallorca Empfehlungskrankenhaus, Krankenhaus Universitari Son Espases. An zwei lieben wir arbeiten hart, sondern genie\u00dfen auch die kleinen Freuden, die das Leben bietet uns, wie Reisen, versuchen, die K\u00fcche der verschiedenen Kulturen, Sport (insbesondere Rennrad, die auch touristische Attraktionen einer der wichtigsten ist Mallorca), lesen (das ist etwas, das meine Schwester, liebt B\u00fccher von Intrigen und science Fiction), usw. Dennoch ist eine unserer gr\u00f6\u00dften Vergn\u00fcgen die Tatsache, in einer Insel wie Mallorca zu leben, weil es eine Menge landschaftliche Vielfalt und F\u00fclle von Aktivit\u00e4ten pr\u00e4sentiert zu tun.\r\n\r\nMallorca bietet Ruhe, wenn gew\u00fcnscht, oder mehr Bewegung, wenn der entgegengesetzte Fall; Strand oder in den Bergen; gutes Essen und Trinken ... F\u00fcr uns wir lieben Orte auf der Insel zu helfen, und empfehlen, die unsere G\u00e4ste w\u00fcnschen, entsprechend den Pr\u00e4ferenzen der einzelnen. Und es ist niemand besser daf\u00fcr als zwei einheimische junge M\u00e4dchen von Mallorca!\r\n\r\nWir haben ziemlich unterwegs (Berlin, Stuttgart, Prag, Paris, Rom, London, Edinburgh, Tunesien, Mexiko, Vietnam, etc.) und haben alle Arten von Situationen (gut und nicht so gut) erlebt, dass uns geholfen haben, wissen, was ist wichtig f\u00fcr einen Reisenden. Deshalb, wenn Sie denken, unser Gast sein, werden wir versuchen, Ihren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie m\u00f6glich und helfen, so viel wie m\u00f6glich zu machen!\r\n\r\nDas Wesentliche f\u00fcr einen Reisenden ist es, einen Ort zu finden, und wie zu Hause f\u00fchlen, um sich nach einem langen Tag zu verbringen Dinge, ohne zu stoppen Besuch. Dies ist, was wir uns finden w\u00fcrden und deshalb werden wir versuchen zu bieten!\r\n\r\nUnd mehr oder weniger das ist unsere \"Reise-Philosophie\" !!\r\n\r\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL\r\n\r\nHola!! \r\n\r\nSomos Mar\u00eda y Caterina Mas, propietarias directas de Ca Na Servera. \r\n\r\nSomos dos hermanas que viven y trabajan en Mallorca. Mar\u00eda es Doctorada en Microbiolog\u00eda Ambiental y trabaja como profesora, mientras que yo (Caterina) soy Cardi\u00f3loga en el hospital de referencia de Mallorca, Hospital Universitari Son Espases. A las dos nos encanta trabajar duro, pero tambi\u00e9n disfrutar de los peque\u00f1os placeres que nos ofrece la vida, como viajar, probar la gastronom\u00eda de diferentes culturas, hacer deporte (sobre todo bici de carretera, que adem\u00e1s es uno de los  grandes atractivos tur\u00edsticos de Mallorca), leer (eso es algo m\u00e1s de mi hermana, le encantan los libros de intriga y de ciencia ficci\u00f3n), etc. A\u00fan as\u00ed, uno de nuestros mayores placeres es el hecho de estar viviendo en una isla como Mallorca, ya que presenta mucha diversidad paisaj\u00edstica y gran cantidad de actividades por hacer. \r\n\r\nMallorca ofrece tranquilidad si se desea, o m\u00e1s movimiento si es el caso contrario; playa o monta\u00f1a; buena comida y bebida... A nosotras nos encanta poder ayudar y recomendar lugares de la isla que pudieran gustar a nuestro hu\u00e9spedes, seg\u00fan las preferencias de cada uno. Y no hay nadie mejor para ello que dos chicas j\u00f3venes aut\u00f3ctonas de Mallorca!\r\n\r\nHemos estado viajando bastante (Berl\u00edn, Stuttgart, Praga, Par\u00eds, Roma, Londres, Edimburgo, T\u00fanez, M\u00e9jico, Vietnam, etc.) y hemos experimentado todo tipo de situaciones (buenas y no tan buenas) que nos han ayudado a saber qu\u00e9 es importante para un viajero. Es por eso que si te planteas ser nuestro hu\u00e9sped, intentaremos que tu estancia sea lo m\u00e1s placentera posible y ayudarte en todo lo posible!\r\n\r\nLo esencial para un viajero es encontrar un lugar donde poder descansar y sentirse como en casa despu\u00e9s de pasar un largo d\u00eda visitando cosas sin parar. Esto es lo que a nosotras nos gustar\u00eda encontrar y que, por tanto, vamos a intentar ofrecer!\r\n\r\nY m\u00e1s o menos \u00e9sta es nuestra \"filosof\u00eda de viaje\"!!",

        "neighborhood_overview": "The LOCATION: Roslindale is a safe and diverse Boston neighborhood located between Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury. This apartment is on Ardale Street, a quiet side street off Centre Street.  This is about one-half mile from Faulkner Hospital, walking distance to the renowned Arnold Arboretum park (look for it on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)), and about 20-minute drive to the Longwood Medical Center area. I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a back yard. Just one block from the house, there is a 7-11 convenience store, a dry-cleaner, a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a popular sports bar and grill (similar to an Irish Pub), and another restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The house is located 1/2 mile from Roslindale Square where you will find more restaurants, 4 bakeries, the public library and the post office. There is a superb farmers market here every Saturday. The fast-train to downtown Boston stops there, too.",
        "notes": "I am in a scenic part of Boston with a couple big parks nearby, and Jamaica Pond, where you can rent a sail boat or jog the paved perimeter path, within a mile away. Here is a clue to my personality:  Favorite singers are Judy Collins, Ari Hest, Miguel Bose and the British rock band, James. My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris and to Tunisia, also. These days I am mostly home, spending a lot of time in front of my iMac, writing copy, filling orders or coding for websites.",
        "transit": "PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From the house, quick public transportation to Forest Hills station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail) is via two nearby MBTA bus lines. The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops one block away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but no service on Sunday. ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the Roslindale Village MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.  GETTING HERE FROM LOGAN AIRPORT: By public transportation: You take the free shuttle bus at the airpo",
        "access": "I am living in the apartment during your stay, and I work from home, so I'm there most of the time.  Guests are welcome to use the kitchen and all cooking utensils, refrigerator, etc. I have a gas stove, toaster oven, microwave, convection oven and a pressure cooker! I have a backyard garden, so if you are here during August and September, be prepared for tomatoes and cucumbers! In addition to your personal room, you can also use the living room which includes a 32-inch HDTV with an Apple TV connection.  The bathroom, adjacent to your room, is shared.  The only room that is off limits is my bedroom on the opposite side of the apartment. I have a clothes washer and dryer in the basement for your use.",
        "interaction": "ABOUT ME: I'm a laid-back, friendly, unmarried guy. I work from home, spending a lot of time on the computer. I have an website that sells handmade things from Mexico. It is called \"Viva Oaxaca Folk Art.\" You will see lots of folk art in the apartment. I also run websites for other small companies. I don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t have overnight guests. I keep regular hours, am friendly, considerate and quiet. I am one of the original Boston AIRBNB hosts, having signed-up with them in 2008.   I am a big traveler myself, and I love hearing stories of where guests have been or where they are heading to next.",
        "house_rules": "I encourage you to use my kitchen, cooking and laundry facilities. There is no additional charge to use the washer/dryer in the basement.  No smoking, inside or outside. Come home as late as you want.  If you come home stumbling drunk, it's OK the first time. If you do it again, and you wake up me or the neighbors downstairs, we will be annoyed.

I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. \r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called \"beta.hifi.archive\" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins. \r\n\r\nSo come to Boston, and stay with me. Enjoy some tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden, explore my world of Mexican folk art, and let's talk about our travel adventures.",

We are really hardworking, but we like enjoying little pleasures that life offers, such as travelling, tasting different culture gastronomy, doing sport (mainly road cycling, that is one of the most touristic attraction of Mallorca), reading (that is a thing that my sister loves), etc. Nevertheless,  one of our most pleasures is the fact that we have the opportunity to live in an island like Mallorca, which has a huge diversity of landscapes and a big quantity of different activities to do!\r\n\r\nHe have been travelling a lot (Berlin, Stuttgart, Prague, Paris, Rome, London, Edinburgh, Tunisia, Mexico, Vietnam, etc.) and we have experimented many situations (good ones and not so good ones) that helped us to know what is important for a traveller. It is for that reason that if you are thinking about being our guest, we will try to help you in whatever you need and try you to have an enjoying stay in Ca Na Servera. \r\n\r\nAn essential thing for a traveller is to find a place where he/she could rest and feel like home after spending a long day visiting different places. That is what we would like for us and, hence, what we would try to achive for you.\r\n\r\nAnd more or less, this is our \u201ctravel philosophy\u201d!!\r\n\r\nDEUTSCH\r\nHallo !!\r\n\r\nWir sind Maria und Caterina Mas, direkten Besitzer von Ca Na Servera.\r\n\r\nWir sind zwei Schwestern, die auf Mallorca leben und arbeiten. Mary ist PhD in Umweltmikrobiologie und arbeitet als Lehrer, w\u00e4hrend ich (Caterina) bin Kardiologe in Mallorca Empfehlungskrankenhaus, Krankenhaus Universitari Son Espases. An zwei lieben wir arbeiten hart, sondern genie\u00dfen auch die kleinen Freuden, die das Leben bietet uns, wie Reisen, versuchen, die K\u00fcche der verschiedenen Kulturen, Sport (insbesondere Rennrad, die auch touristische Attraktionen einer der wichtigsten ist Mallorca), lesen (das ist etwas, das meine Schwester, liebt B\u00fccher von Intrigen und science Fiction), usw. Dennoch ist eine unserer gr\u00f6\u00dften Vergn\u00fcgen die Tatsache, in einer Insel wie Mallorca zu leben, weil es eine Menge landschaftliche Vielfalt und F\u00fclle von Aktivit\u00e4ten pr\u00e4sentiert zu tun.\r\n\r\nMallorca bietet Ruhe, wenn gew\u00fcnscht, oder mehr Bewegung, wenn der entgegengesetzte Fall; Strand oder in den Bergen; gutes Essen und Trinken ... F\u00fcr uns wir lieben Orte auf der Insel zu helfen, und empfehlen, die unsere G\u00e4ste w\u00fcnschen, entsprechend den Pr\u00e4ferenzen der einzelnen. Und es ist niemand besser daf\u00fcr als zwei einheimische junge M\u00e4dchen von Mallorca!\r\n\r\nWir haben ziemlich unterwegs (Berlin, Stuttgart, Prag, Paris, Rom, London, Edinburgh, Tunesien, Mexiko, Vietnam, etc.) und haben alle Arten von Situationen (gut und nicht so gut) erlebt, dass uns geholfen haben, wissen, was ist wichtig f\u00fcr einen Reisenden. Deshalb, wenn Sie denken, unser Gast sein, werden wir versuchen, Ihren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie m\u00f6glich und helfen, so viel wie m\u00f6glich zu machen!\r\n\r\nDas Wesentliche f\u00fcr einen Reisenden ist es, einen Ort zu finden, und wie zu Hause f\u00fchlen, um sich nach einem langen Tag zu verbringen Dinge, ohne zu stoppen Besuch. Dies ist, was wir uns finden w\u00fcrden und deshalb werden wir versuchen zu bieten!\r\n\r\nUnd mehr oder weniger das ist unsere \"Reise-Philosophie\" !!\r\n\r\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL\r\n\r\nHola!! \r\n\r\nSomos Mar\u00eda y Caterina Mas, propietarias directas de Ca Na Servera. \r\n\r\nSomos dos hermanas que viven y trabajan en Mallorca. Mar\u00eda es Doctorada en Microbiolog\u00eda Ambiental y trabaja como profesora, mientras que yo (Caterina) soy Cardi\u00f3loga en el hospital de referencia de Mallorca, Hospital Universitari Son Espases. A las dos nos encanta trabajar duro, pero tambi\u00e9n disfrutar de los peque\u00f1os placeres que nos ofrece la vida, como viajar, probar la gastronom\u00eda de diferentes culturas, hacer deporte (sobre todo bici de carretera, que adem\u00e1s es uno de los  grandes atractivos tur\u00edsticos de Mallorca), leer (eso es algo m\u00e1s de mi hermana, le encantan los libros de intriga y de ciencia ficci\u00f3n), etc. A\u00fan as\u00ed, uno de nuestros mayores placeres es el hecho de estar viviendo en una isla como Mallorca, ya que presenta mucha diversidad paisaj\u00edstica y gran cantidad de actividades por hacer. \r\n\r\nMallorca ofrece tranquilidad si se desea, o m\u00e1s movimiento si es el caso contrario; playa o monta\u00f1a; buena comida y bebida... A nosotras nos encanta poder ayudar y recomendar lugares de la isla que pudieran gustar a nuestro hu\u00e9spedes, seg\u00fan las preferencias de cada uno. Y no hay nadie mejor para ello que dos chicas j\u00f3venes aut\u00f3ctonas de Mallorca!\r\n\r\nHemos estado viajando bastante (Berl\u00edn, Stuttgart, Praga, Par\u00eds, Roma, Londres, Edimburgo, T\u00fanez, M\u00e9jico, Vietnam, etc.) y hemos experimentado todo tipo de situaciones (buenas y no tan buenas) que nos han ayudado a saber qu\u00e9 es importante para un viajero. Es por eso que si te planteas ser nuestro hu\u00e9sped, intentaremos que tu estancia sea lo m\u00e1s placentera posible y ayudarte en todo lo posible!\r\n\r\nLo esencial para un viajero es encontrar un lugar donde poder descansar y sentirse como en casa despu\u00e9s de pasar un largo d\u00eda visitando cosas sin parar. Esto es lo que a nosotras nos gustar\u00eda encontrar y que, por tanto, vamos a intentar ofrecer!\r\n\r\nY m\u00e1s o menos \u00e9sta es nuestra \"filosof\u00eda de viaje\"!!",

We're just learning how to travel with small children which gives us a whole new appreciation for how much travelling needs differ between people.  We'd like to think we're considerate guests and friendly accommodating (though not interfering) hosts.\r\n\r\nRachael works in local government and Shahram designs chandeliers and we both love discovering new places, home or away (though our recent trip to Tunisia was a bit hairy!)",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Clapham has two main areas for evening entertainment; Clapham High Street and Clapham Junction. Clapham Junction boasts the famous Clapham Grand, a venue hosting a great variety of events depending on the night. Most tastes are catered for in the Grand at some time or other, and the place has a great feel to it. Inigo is a much smaller bar/club about five minutes from the station, and plays a wide range of funky house and dance music along with regular promotional drinks offers. Clapham Junction also has a Rileys' 24-hour pool bar, which is a bit of a boys club and hosts both pool and poker tournaments.",
        "notes": null,
        "transit": "Transportation Clapham Junction is about eight minutes from Waterloo, with 35 trains an hour. It's nice to have guaranteed timing in your journey to work! There are no Underground stations in Clapham Junction but with so many trains, it hardly seems to matter. The station also provides you with the opportunity for a day out almost anywhere in the south of England without too much hassle. The High Street has three stations on the Northern Line (Clapham South, North and Common), which can all have you in the West End or the city in fifteen minutes . Clapham High Street, a small usually unmanned station, also has a service to Victoria. The area also has regular night buses from central London; so you'll never have to leave your drink/pull/friends to go and catch that irritatingly full last train home.",

So far I've been to Kenya, Thailand, the United States, Turky, Marrocco, Tunisia and of course to a few countries of western Europe (my neighbours ! Italy, Belgium, Spain, England, Ireland).\r\nI've got a lot see and i hope I'll be on a plane really soon !\r\nMy other passion is cinema : i watch a lot of movies on dvds, at the theatres, i read magazines, write on a blog, etc...a real cinema buff !\r\nWhen I travel, I prefer renting a place to stay rather than going to a hotel : it's cheaper for one if you want to take the time to discover a city, and it's cosier as well : you can feel \"at home\" whereas you're abroad, it makes the experience the more appreciable. \r\nHope you'll enjoy your stay in Paris !!",

Let me show you around.\r\nI live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. \r\n I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.\r\nAs a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.\r\nIn addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (URL HIDDEN) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.\r\nWelcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!",

There are many things but among all, for me horseback riding and dancing are the 2 things that give me the feeling of ecstatic and make me happy to be alive! After that, there are traveling to discover the world, eating good food, spending time with people that I like, meditation, feeling getting ahead with things and just simply learning things!\r\n\r\nWhen I am not in Paris, my assistant Mark and his wife will take care of your check in and out and to help you throughout your stay.

I am very well linked to the place where you will arrive in Rome! To reach home from main railway station Termini there is A metro line (only 4 stops, 1 km from home) or a direct bus. To reach home from Fiumicino airport there is a train that stops a Roma Tuscolana (1,5 km from home), or another train that goes to Termini station and cheaper buses that goes to Termini station as well.

Please also don't take too long showers. While you are here, I will clean as often as I can the common area (because of italian law I cannot clean your room). There is unlimited wi-fi access to the internet in the house! The washing machine is \u20ac5 for each use. I will do it for you. I cannot include breakfast in my offer (always because of the italian law) but you can cook your own! Check-in is after 4 p.m., check out is before 12 a.m., please respect these times.

If you need to leave your luggage before check-in time you could do it from 12 PM, ask me in advance to be sure it will be possible. If you will need to leave your luggage for some hours after the check-out we have to agree how, ask me in advance to be sure it will be possibile. If you came late at night (after 8 PM) I will let you find the keys without me being there. I live in a very close house, so if you need some help you can call me with the house phone.

minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

Let me show you around.\r\nI live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. \r\n I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.\r\nAs a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.\r\nIn addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (URL HIDDEN) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.\r\nWelcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!",

minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

Currently I have been living in the Santa Cruz area for the past 6 years and I am raising my two sons, ages 9 and 7. They attend a local Waldorf school. I am co-parenting and they live with me half time.\r\n\r\nI have traveled to Europe twice and visited Italy, Denmark, Stockholm and Russia, Tunisia. Additionally I have been exploring the US, most recently spent time in Washington, DC, Las Vegas, Arizona,and the Los Angeles area.\r\n\r\nFor fun I ride my mountain bike, do Pilates and yoga, and  swim in my own pool. I am a big Netflix fan and I love to dance and listen to music.\r\n\r\nI am enjoying sharing my home in the Santa Cruz mountains with visitors from around the world.  I'm very open-minded, generous and  I will try my best to make you feel welcome in my home.",

I've lived in Scotland for a year and loved it. I'd enjoy traveling overseas more, so far I've been to the U.S., India, Russia and Tunisia. \r\nI've got three sisters, and enjoy traveling with family as well as with friends. I've been studying art and am always in museums, especially Italy when traveling. I love reading, eating (a lot) and like to think of myself as a whisky connoisseur. I enjoy discovering new things and am very open minded for new cultures and anything that touches history, literature and art.",

Our guest were mostly very polite, offering a bottle of wine, or paying for dinner. Sometimes they only had their company to contribute, which was plenty. We were happy to share our good fortune with others and contribute to the travel community. We were working pubcrawls in Rome at the time, which was mostly an expat community, and had a lot of freedom to work when we pleased, because it was all commission- which allowed us to be flexible with our guests.\r\n\r\nI've hearrd stories of it not working out. but from my personal experiences, i havent any regrets.\r\n\r\nInterests\r\n\r\n(website hidden)\r\n\r\nProbably the same as most this couch surf community.

Some rooms have period features and large windows with garden view.\r\n\r\nWe offer a large variety of rooms: diversified by their size, colour and price.\r\n\r\nWe have onsite parking and a meeting room is available for hire. It offers a pleasant ambiance for board meetings or private reunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caspian is a 2 minutes\u2019 walk from Ealing Broadway Station and 15 minutes from Central London. Ealing Broadway shopping centres, restaurants and all amenities are a short walk. Our sister La Baguette coffee shop/restaurant offers delicious Tunisian and international food (10% discount for Hotel guests). \r\n\r\nSo much is going on in Ealing: Ealing Summer Festivals (Jazz, Blues, Comedy, Beer, Carnival) in July, Ealing Half Marathon in September.\r\n ...and around Ealing: Sport and Music events at Wembley Stadium all year, and the unique grand Westfield Shopping Malls is a short bus or train ride. The significant Walpole Park along with Pitzhanger Manor are a short stroll from Caspian.\r\n\r\nCaspian Hotel is just 20 minutes\u2019 drive from Heathrow Airport. The M4, M40 and A406 motorways are only 5 minutes\u2019 drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caspian has been visited by top consultant Alex Polizzi from The Hotel Inspector TV Series on 3 consecutive years.",

I never stop exploring, discovering and evolving.\r\nI love the Arts and creative people! Life to me is a storybook full of fascinating tales. I amass information 'on the hoof' and very little passes me by. Understanding what makes others tick is meat and drink to me and proves to be a source of endless joy.\r\nI always keep my mind active. I love beauty in all forms, I am well educated and I like to remain totally classless. This makes it easy for me to get on with just about any sort of person. I am thought-provoking and even quite deep on occasions.\r\nI organise luxury tours in Italy for small parties and occasionally I escort them, as I am a professional tour guide too. I get involved in other exciting things which keep me busy too, such as painting, reading books, newspaper and cultural magazines, photography, video editing, cycling, theatre, music, fitness and movies.\r\nI strongly believe a very clean, secure, welcoming feel, and comfortable house is of paramount importance for travellers who don't want to break their bank account! \r\nI have been travelling on my own since the age of 14! I have been an exchange student in Baltimore for a year at the age of 18  and then at 20 I visited 36 States in the U.S. on a three cross Country tour. Been in Hawaii, Canada, Singapore and Malaysia, Maldives, Brazil,  Mexico, Costa Rica, Morocco, Tunisia, Cape Verde, Turkey and all Western European Countries.\r\nWhen you stay at my place I will make you feel a member of my family as my life's golden rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated! \r\nI am always on an adventure. Enjoy hearing about people's travels and life styles. It stands to good reason why you would enjoy staying in my home: it is a warm and caring place. \r\nI look forward to meeting you and show the true Mediterranean hospitality with an English twist!\r\nSincerely,\r\nAdriano :-)\r\n\r\nSocializzo con facilit\u00e0, rido di gusto, mi intrigano i cervelli acuti e mi innervosicono gli arroganti prepotenti; mi annoiano i \"lagnosi\" fine a se stessi ma ascolto volentieri chi ha bisogno di un consiglio o di un sostegno per trovare una soluzione. Non sopporto le ingiustizie, la superficialit\u00e0 e mi innamoro di chi \u00e8 capace di godere delle piccole cose e di chi, come dice Aristotele, \"prova un senso di dubbio e di meraviglia, riconosce di non sapere e per liberarsi dall'ignoranza ricerca il conoscere...\"",

Bushwick is north Brooklyn, on the border of Ridgewood, Queens.  North Brooklyn has a very different feel than Manhattan, but is only a 15 min subway ride to the heart of downtown - Union Square or lower east side.  Recently, there has been a great migration of artists and young working people who have moved out here.   Bushwick has a certain edginess and grit that can be seen with the many murals, art, and graffiti on buildings.   It still has a Hispanic / Caribbean feel and sound, but it has changed dramatically to become more of a melting pot.   Bushwick is soon becoming one of the most coveted neighborhoods in NYC to live in, and rents are going up.  The nightlife is booming, and new restaurants / bars are opening every week.

We have lived in New York for 6+ years, and have decided Bushwick is the best place for us!  Here is a little more about us, our apartment, Bushwick, and everything in between:\r\n\r\nWe love cooking and eating, are social, and love travelling.  We take lots of weekend trips to visit family and friends.  Alondra is a fantastic cook, loves all things fashion, and is a native Puerto Rican.  Bobby loves his sports, his beer, and originally hails from the great nation of Texas.  We have been hosts since summer of 2014, and we have hosted people from over 35 different cities all over the world!!  We like to socialize with our guests some at nights, but respect privacy always.  We cook 3-4 times a week at home in the evening, and we love to share some wine or beer with our guests!\r\n\r\nOur schedules are quite busy, Bobby working in downtown Manhattan at American Express, and Alondra works for Tommy Hilfiger in Chelsea, on the west side of Manhattan.  We both are out during days, but are reachable always and return in the evenings.\r\n\r\nOur apartment is beautiful.  The moment we walked in 3 years ago, we both knew it would be our home for sometime to come.  Railroad style, there are 2 big bedrooms on opposite side of the apartment from one another.  The kitchen, bathroom, and living room all have brand new appliances, with high ceilings and recessed lighting.  The brick makes it feel more homey.  The apartment is safe, and the building is quiet.\r\n\r\nBushwick is an awesome place to live.  It has a certain uniqueness to it, the culture, art, and lifestyle are really one of a kind; which make it the most diverse neighborhood in NYC.  We have also found it contains some of the best and cheapest food also.  With easy access to Union Sq and the lower east side (each 15 mins) it's super accessible to Manhattan so you never feel too far away from the center of the world.  We can't imagine living anywhere else in NYC.\r\n\r\nOf course we know New York very well, so we are more than willing to give advice, and help plan out a fun day or weekend.  We are looking forward to being your host!!",

Let me show you around.\r\nI live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. \r\n I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.\r\nAs a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.\r\nIn addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (URL HIDDEN) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.\r\nWelcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!",

The baguette is perfectly decent. \"La traditionnelle\" and their nuts bread are also good. This is where I take my everyday baguette.

The village-like neighbourhood also seems to make a point of disproving clich\u00e9s, with people of many ethnicities and creeds living together amicably, which, as a visitor, means you'll have no problems eating out and shopping for groceries to your taste ! Go for a coffee or a show at La Maison des Metallos (the old metalworkers union house turned theater), or check the farmers market on Richard Lenoir to find typical french foodstuffs (including creole and Tunisian delicacies).  Walk up the street to visit Menilmontant and its north-african eateries, then head through Belleville's chinatown to see Paris from the terrace above the park on Belleville hill, or go west and stroll along Canal St Martin : every other street brings a different mood.",
        "notes": "The neighbourhood is lively and can get a bit loud on weekend nights : since the studio's windows face street-side, and despite good soundproofing glass, we do not recommend it if you are a light sleeper. We have iron and board downstairs for you to borrow, and same goes for phone landline (calls to many international LL are no-charge, too). Minimum 2 nights Stay. Paris survival tip  :  Just make sure to open with \"Bonjour\" before you break into english (a mildly apologetic look helps, too) and you'll find people get out of their way to be helpful. :)",
        "transit": "Moving around with public transportation is easy (as is generally the case inside Paris) :  The R\u00e9publique station is a 5' walk, and is a major Metro (tube) hub.  There are several other Metro and bus lines within a few hundred yards  range. [Closest is Parmentier, on line N\u00b03] If you feel adventurous, the Velib service (pick up and ride bicycles) dares you to try biking around Paris !",
        "access": "The studio includes a bathroom (with walk-in shower), a mini kitchen including a mix-mode oven, toaster, kettle, coffee machine (but no cooking plates), fridge and freezer.  Internet access provided via WiFi (fiber).   We can provide a baby crib and bathtub on request (\u20ac 20 fee). The neighbourhood offers a wide array of restaurants, stores and take-away stalls, and two laundromats within a 100 meters on the same street.",
        "interaction": "We will welcome you on arrival and see you out on departure. You're welcome to reach out at any time during your stay, should you need any help or tips \u2013 we live right downstairs We speak fluent French and English, can do horrible things to a number of other languages and will be delighted to help you find your bearings in the neighbourhood and around Paris. If you have any special needs or preferences that can't easily be accommodated in a pinch, please let us know ahead of your visit so we can look into arrangements by the time of your arrival.",
        "house_rules": "We go by the \"don't be a dick\" ruleset. EX: The studio is nominally non-smoking, but if you toast one by the window, we probably won't tell your mom. In the same spirit, we have no objections to pets, but you're accountable for yours : if your purse dog is in the habit of yapping in anguish when left alone, don't lock it in the flat when you go out at night, lest it gets rescued. Please make an enquiry prior to requesting a reservation : I do my best to keep the calendar updated but life is known to happen (guests extending their stay, visiting relatives, etc). Also, we shamelessly discriminate against people who can't be bothered to RTFM. ;) When in doubt, ask : we'll try our best to answer any question.",

Let me show you around.\r\nI live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. \r\n I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.\r\nAs a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.\r\nIn addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (URL HIDDEN) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.\r\nWelcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Pigneto is the area of young people and full of night life! In the morning, in the close pedestrian area there is well-stocked street market and the area looks familiar. In the nights is full of restaurants, pubs, bars where you can enjoy night life. If you don't like night life, no problems: the house is not in the most busy area, but in an adiacent street very quiet where you can relax in peace!",
        "notes": "Now we don't have yet internet in the house, but just out of the door there are many place where to use wi-fi for free :-)",
        "transit": "At few metres there is the stop of many trams that will lead you to the main train station termini and historical center. The area is  very well linked to the place where you will arrive in Rome! Train station, bus stations, airports.",
        "access": "You can use the full equipped kitchen to cook your meals and eat them on the table in the living room. You can relax on the sofa and watch TV (also if I suggest you to enjoy Rome!) The bathroom has a very modern shower and a washing machine (to be paid separately - \u20ac5 for washing). I cannot include breakfast in my offer (always because of the italian law) but you can cook your own! Check-in is after 4 p.m., check out is before 12 a.m., please respect these times. Normally I cannot change these times because I have guests before you and after you. For pratical reasons it's not possible to leave your luggage before the check-in or after the check-out. In the not far Termini station there is a depot for luggage. If you want to be sure to be able to do an early check-in or a late check-out simply book another nights before or after your stay! ;-) Of course we will have to agree for the check-in time as soon as possibile and anyway some days BEFORE that you arrive. You can see on the Airbnb",
        "interaction": "With pleasure we will meet at the check in, I will give you a free map of Roma, I will show you the house, let you sign a contract  for the staying (necessary for italian law) and ask you for your details because I have to send them to the italian government. In case of problems or needs I will be available to help you. If you would like to interact more, I will be glad to know you better, do something together and maybe make friendship ! :-)",
        "house_rules": "Non rompere niente! Chiudi sempre le finestre quando esci. Non aprire la porta di casa ad estranei. Il check-in \u00e8 dalle 16, il check-out \u00e8 entro le 12. Non disturbare i vicini, specialmente di notte. Risparmia energia per la Terra. Non perdere le chiavi. Divertiti! :-D ********** Don't break anything! Always close the windows when you exit. Don't open the front door to anyone that you don't know. Check-in is after 4 p.m., check out is before 12 a.m. Don't be too noisy for the neighbours, especially at night. Save energy for the Earth. Don't lose the keys. Try to have fun! :-D",

minded and very curios, I can be very shy and people say that I look very gentle and peaceful. \r\nI try to always see things from another point of view, but I can be also very lazy in doing real stuff. \r\nI have a lot of interests but I am also dispersive. \r\nI can be very simple and very complicated: I have lot of contradictions and doubts! :-)\r\nI am antifascist, antiraxist, antisexist and antispecist. \r\nI think everyone must be free and alive so I don't eat animal and I don't eat or use anything that comes from animals: someone would say I am vegan. :-) \r\nI like to read, photography, to spend time on computers, to cook, to eat, to drink, to meet strange people, to love, to relax on the beach, to trekking on mountains, animals, to walk. \r\n\r\n******************\r\nMi chiamo Alfredo, sono nato a Roma e sempre vissuto qui.\r\nSono un ragazzo normale a cui non piace la normalit\u00e0, quindi spesso faccio un casino nella vita.\r\nSono di mentalit\u00e0 aperta e molto curioso, posso essere molto timido e dicono che sembro molto gentile e pacioso.\r\nCerco sempre di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista, ma posso anche essere molto pigro nell'attivarmi.\r\nHo molti interessi ma sono anche dispersivo.\r\nPosso essere molto semplice e molto complicato: ho un sacco di contraddizioni e dubbi! :-)\r\nSono antifascista, antirazzista, antisessista e antispecista.\r\nPenso che tutti debbano essere liberi e vivi quindi non mangio animali e non mangio o uso niente che viene dagli animali: qualcuno potrebbe dire che sono vegano. :-)\r\nMi piace leggere, la fotografia, perdere tempo al pc, cucinare, mangiare, bere, incontrare persone strane, amare, rilassarmi sulla spiaggia, fare trekking in montagna, gli animali, viaggiare.\r\n\r\nI HOSTED

Un brunch \u00e0 la Butte aux cailles, bronzer et lire un bon livre aux Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Sortir boire un verre au Caf\u00e9 Ch\u00e9rie,44 boulevard de la villette, ou dans le quartier Oberkampf.\r\n\r\nPour les sorties shopping direction le Marais, les friperies et les boutiques de cr\u00e9ateurs. Et souvent j'en profite pour manger une glace chez Pozzetto, des glaces italiennes d\u00e9licieuses, 39 Rue du Roi de Sicile.\r\n\r\nDe plus, j'adore voyager j'ai visit\u00e9 les Etats-Unis, le Canada, le Maroc, la Tunisie, et quelques pays d'Europe, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au sud pour le soleil. Je voyage plut\u00f4t avec un sac \u00e0 dos et je loge chez l'habitant ou en auberge de jeunesse.
